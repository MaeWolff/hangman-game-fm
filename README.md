### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to use Nuxt.js, as it was my first project using Vue.js framework. I discovered the structure that Nuxt.js provides for building scalable Vue applications. Additionally, I gained experience in integrating Pinia for state management, and Cypress with Cucumber for integration testing. Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me in Vue.js ecosystem and frontend development.
